      "project_description":"The Lower Fraser estuary has been heavily modified by the historic construction of large in-channel structures such as dikes and jetties, which were installed to improve navigation to the extensive port facilities in the area. While these structures serve their intended purpose, they restrict the lateral flow of the river arms to Sturgeon and Roberts Banks, and discourage the exchange of water and sediment between the rivers and its delta. Natural nutrient, sediment, and biogeochemical processes which support a healthy delta and marsh are not functioning efficiently. Tidal marsh habitats in the Fraser estuary provide productive rearing areas for juvenile salmon, and have been reduced to a fraction of their historic area. The Raincoast Conservation Foundation estuary connectivity project will improve fish access to tidal marsh habitat in the Fraser River South Arm over 4 years by modifying existing jetties and flood control infrastructure that is currently impairing the ability of the area to provide habitat to fish. These activities will directly benefit juvenile chinook and other Pacific salmon species, as well as many other species which rely on the estuary. Better access throughout the Fraser estuary will potentially improve early marine survival for Pacific salmon.",

A primary KSRP goal is the restoration of sockeye salmon in the Coquitlam Reservoir. A critical uncertainty identified for this goal is the feasibility of providing safe and effective downstream passage for smolts from the reservoir to the lower river. Using data from other fish passage facilities and site-specific information, this project will evaluate passage feasibility and develop a concept-level design and cost estimate for a chosen alternative. The project will also address potential operational modifications to attract smolts to the outlet at the south end of the reservoir.",

This habitat complex produces 50% of coho salmon smolts for the watershed (3,300 coho smolts per year) and 75,000 chum fry each year. In February 2017, a weather event resulted in high flows and sedimentation of this habitat, which infilled and greatly reduced access and productivity in Archery Pond. This project excavated the accumulated sediments, reshaped the existing head pond, and excavated a new larger sediment pond that is easy to access for clean out. In addition, a new spawning side channel was constructed creating a total amount of new habitat: 100 square-metre sediment detention pond and 100 square-metre spawning habitat.",

This section of the river also provides the only remaining spawning habitat for 500,000 chum and hundreds of coho, pink, and Chinook salmon. In 2007, Fraser Valley Watershed Coalition and partners took actions to create more complex spawning habitat (off-channels) appropriate for the tail-water release flows of the Ruskin Dam. These channels (1 through 5) were anticipated to require management every ten to twenty to ensure gravel and bar movement. This project is part of a continued effort to manage these channels.",

The Peach Creek Extension Channel is an off-channel habitat to support increased salmon spawning. Lack of gravel recruitment in the upper reaches of the Chilliwack River limits spawning by chinook salmon, steelhead, and other salmonid species in downstream areas. Primary project objectives were to increase viable off-channel habitats to support rearing, overwintering, and spawning salmon, wildlife, and overall biodiversity. Restoration efforts targeted three main project sites: 1) Stewart Creek, 2) Street Creek, and 3) Peach Creek Extension Channel.\n\nPeach Creek Extension Channel is an off-channel habitat designed to support increased salmon spawning within the lower Vedder River. An area that has been influenced by development, upstream natural geological instability, controlled flows through dykes and changes to the natural floodplain, resulting in the loss of historic off-channel systems. Excavated gravels were trucked up to Foley Creek, to augment spawning habitat in the upper watershed.",
